## 📌 Project Overview

This project served as an introduction to business analysis and stakeholder communication. As a beginning Business Intelligence Analyst, I was tasked with reviewing a set of visuals and pre-analyzed insights to construct a report for stakeholders at **Fresh Beats**, a dynamic music streaming platform and promotional tool for emerging artists.

The report connects visual insights to real business challenges, offering clear, data-driven recommendations in the areas of user engagement, artist promotion, and genre-specific marketing strategies.

## 💼 Business Objectives

1. **Artist Promotion Effectiveness**  
   Determine which strategies help promoted artists get more exposure and engagement.

2. **User Engagement & Conversion**  
   Increase the number of paid subscribers by analyzing usage behavior of free vs. paid users.

3. **Genre-Based Promotion**  
   Understand which genres perform best across user types to tailor marketing and recommendation systems.

## 🔍 Key Insights & Recommendations

### 🎧 Genre Trends
- **Electronic and Hip Hop** are on the rise.
- **Pop** peaked in 2021 and is now declining.

**Recommendation:**  
Focus marketing on rising genres, and investigate why Pop is declining to adjust platform positioning.

---

### 👥 User Tier Analysis
- **Paid users listen to significantly more music** than free users.

**Recommendation:**  
Launch referral programs and time-limited offers to convert free users to paid. Consider creating intermediate-tier subscription options.

---

### 🎸 Free vs Paid Genre Patterns
- **Rock** is the most popular genre among free users.  
- **Indie** is more popular among paid users.

**Recommendation:**  
Run genre-specific promotions (e.g., rock playlists with trial offers) to convert free users. Focus Indie content on existing paid users to increase engagement.
