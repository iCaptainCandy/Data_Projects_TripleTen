## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to help a client evaluate the Manhattan vacation rental market using historical Airbnb data. The client wanted to identify the most attractive neighborhoods and property sizes for short-term rentals, and estimate the potential annual revenue of top-performing listings.

Using spreadsheet-based data analysis techniques such as pivot tables, IF statements, and SUMIF logic, I conducted a full analysis of Airbnb listing trends, user preferences, and revenue projections based on rental activity.

## 💼 Business Questions Answered

1. **Which neighborhoods and property sizes are most attractive for vacation rentals?**  
   - Evaluated neighborhood performance using reviews from the last 12 months  
   - Identified top-10 neighborhoods and most popular bedroom sizes

2. **Do neighborhoods have different preferences for property size?**  
   - Mapped bedroom popularity per neighborhood using pivot tables

3. **How much money did these listings generate?**  
   - Calculated estimated monthly and annual revenue by joining listing and calendar data  
   - Used SUMIF() logic and filters to isolate top listings based on defined criteria

## 📈 Key Findings

- **Top neighborhoods** for vacation rentals included Harlem, Midtown, and the Lower East Side.
- **1-bedroom apartments** were the most popular across most neighborhoods, with **studios** being dominant in Midtown.
- The **top-earning listing** generated nearly **$30,000 in one month**, suggesting a projected **annual revenue of $360,000+**.
- **Rock-solid formatting and cleaning practices** were applied, including:
  - A cleaned `neighborhood_clean` column
  - A new `bedrooms_clean` column to reclassify studio listings
  - Documented logic and changes in a change log tab
