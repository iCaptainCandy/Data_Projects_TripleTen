## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to help a client evaluate the Manhattan vacation rental market using historical Airbnb data. The client wanted to identify the most attractive neighborhoods and property sizes for short-term rentals, and estimate the potential annual revenue of top-performing listings.

Using spreadsheet-based data analysis techniques such as pivot tables, IF statements, and SUMIF logic, I conducted a full analysis of Airbnb listing trends, user preferences, and revenue projections based on rental activity.

2. **Do neighborhoods have different preferences for property size?**  
   - Mapped bedroom popularity per neighborhood using pivot tables

3. **How much money did these listings generate?**  
   - Calculated estimated monthly and annual revenue by joining listing and calendar data  
   - Used SUMIF() logic and filters to isolate top listings based on defined criteria
