## 🧠 Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed data scraped from the Shopify App Store to understand what contributes to an app’s success, based on public ratings, developer responsiveness, and user engagement. The goal was to create an organized, insight-rich Power BI report that explores relationships between reviews, developers, responsiveness, and helpfulness scores.

The project is structured into **three main sections**, each reflected in its own Power BI report tab.
