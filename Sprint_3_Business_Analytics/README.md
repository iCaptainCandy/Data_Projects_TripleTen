## ðŸ§  Project Overview

In this sprint, I was hired as a junior analyst for an e-commerce company to transform raw transactional logs into meaningful business insights. The dataset included user-level event activity such as product views, cart openings, and purchases.

My objective was to:
- Build a **conversion funnel** to assess user flow from product view to purchase
- Prepare **cohort analysis data** to measure customer retention by acquisition month
- Calculate **retention rates** across monthly cohorts
- Organize and document the spreadsheet for executive-level review

## ðŸ“Š Funnel Analysis

### Goal: Understand how effectively users convert through the website

**Stages of the funnel:**
1. Product Page Views  
2. Cart Opens  
3. Purchases  

- Built a pivot table (`conversion_funnel` tab) using unique user counts
- Calculated total and step-by-step conversion rates
- Found opportunities to improve the conversion from cart to purchase

## ðŸ“ˆ Cohort Analysis & Retention

### Goal: Track customer retention by acquisition month

- Filtered **only purchase events** into a `purchase_activity` sheet  
- Calculated each userâ€™s **first purchase date** via pivot table (`first_purchase`)
- Created 3 helper columns in `purchase_activity`:
  - `event_month` (when purchase occurred)
  - `first_purchase_month` (acquisition cohort)
  - `cohort_age` (months since acquisition)

- Aggregated user count per cohort and age group in `cohort_analysis`
- Used fixed formulas in `retention_rates` tab to calculate retention % over months 1â€“4

## ðŸ§¾ Executive Summary & Structure

- Used a clearly structured **Table of Contents**
- Wrote summaries for:
  - Results of the funnel and retention analysis
  - Key assumptions (event logic, cohort definitions, user count usage)
- Reordered tabs and added formatting for executive readability
