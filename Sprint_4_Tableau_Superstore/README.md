## 🧠 Project Overview

In this sprint, I worked as a consultant for a struggling superstore to analyze its operations and uncover ways to increase profitability and avoid bankruptcy. Using Tableau and the `Superstore.xls` dataset, I designed a multi-part dashboard that explores profit centers, product return rates, advertising strategy, and customer behavior.
