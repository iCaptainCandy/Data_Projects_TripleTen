# 📊 Jaymeson Metz – Business Intelligence Portfolio

Welcome! I'm Jaymeson Metz, a data and business intelligence analyst with a passion for transforming messy datasets into clean insights and visual storytelling. This portfolio contains all 7 projects completed during my Business Intelligence Analytics program at **TripleTen**, where I built real-world dashboards, wrote SQL queries, modeled customer cohorts, and designed end-to-end BI workflows.

Each sprint focused on a different skillset—from spreadsheets to SQL, Tableau, and Power BI—culminating in a capstone analysis for Zomato’s customer data.
