## 🧠 Project Overview

As part of my onboarding assignment at Zomato, I was tasked with conducting a **Business Intelligence analysis** using internal datasets. I selected **Restaurant Analysis** as my focus area.

The objective was to explore and segment Zomato’s user base, understand behavioral trends, and generate actionable insights through a research-backed dashboard and structured visual presentation.

## 📁 Provided Datasets (from Team Lead)

- `users` — information on Zomato’s customer base  
- `orders` — order-level transaction data  
- `restaurant` — metadata about restaurants on the platform  
- `menu` — items offered by each restaurant  
- `food` — additional food-level details

## 🔍 Research Focus: Customer Analysis

**Main Questions:**
1. Who are Zomato’s customers, and how can we segment them?
2. What behavioral patterns (order frequency, spend, cuisine preference) can we detect?
3. Are there distinct high-value vs low-value customer profiles?
4. Which customer segments contribute most to revenue or repeat orders?

## 📄 Research Plan Highlights

- Created a **mock-up wireframe** of the intended dashboard layout
- Identified key KPIs: Total Users, Repeat Order Rate, Average Order Value, Segment Share
- Defined hypotheses around:
  - High-frequency vs. low-frequency users  
  - Behavioral correlation between cuisine preference and loyalty  
  - Order timing clusters (weekday vs weekend)

**Visualizations planned:**
- Bar charts of customer segments by frequency  
- Heatmaps of cuisine preference by region  
- Line charts of order activity over time  
- Pie/donut charts showing repeat order share  
- KPI cards for overall metrics
